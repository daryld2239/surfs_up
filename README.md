# surfs_up

## Project Overview

The surf's shop "Surfs Up," is looking to expand with the next potential location beign Oahu, Hawaii. Though they mostly offer surfing gear, they would like to expand with to include an ice cream shop.

Even though the average annual weather conditons for Oahu are great, there are concerns of the weather conditions of June and December. SO we want to analyze the weather data to see if it would be suistainable to operate their business year round.

## Resources
- Data Source: hawaii.sqlite
- Software: SQLite, SQLAlchemy, Flask, VS Code

## Results

### June Temperature Statistics

- average temperature is 74.94 degrees
- the temperature is 77 degrees or higher for about one week out of the month
- the temperature ranges from 64-85 degrees

## Summary

Based on the analysis of the weather conditions in Decemember and June, our findings show that is more than favorable to open a surf shop and ice cream shop in Oahu year round. The tempature stays rather consister in the months of June and Decemeber, with the stand deviation for June is 3.25 degree fahrenheit, and the month of December its 3.74 degrees. Some additional queries for future finding is to determine the how much precepertation happens, and when it is more likely to happen. We could use this data to track climate change, and to see if the weather has stayed the same or has increased.
