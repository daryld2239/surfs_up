## Project Overview

The surf's shop "Surfs Up," is looking to expand with the next potential location beign Oahu, Hawaii. Though they mostly offer surfing gear, they would like to expand with to include an ice cream shop.

Even though the average annual weather conditons for Oahu are great, there are concerns of the weather conditions of June and December. SO we want to analyze the weather data to see if it would be suistainable to operate their business year round.
